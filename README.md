# Fayda CreditLink: Smart Loans for Health and Agriculture

## ðŸ‘¥ Contributors:

## ðŸ“Œ Project Synopsis:

### ðŸš¨ Problem Statement:
Many Ethiopians lack access to formal loans. Farmers and patients especially need support, but banks donâ€™t have reliable ways to evaluate their risk. Thereâ€™s also risk of misuse with cash-based loans.

### ðŸ’¡ Planned Solution:
This platform securely links each personâ€™s **Fayda National ID** to their **bank account** using VeriFayda OIDC. It uses **AI analysis on transaction behavior** to assess eligibility for **non-cash loans**:
- Medical support (medicine, tests, surgery)
- Agriculture support (seeds, fertilizer, tools)

Users donâ€™t receive cashâ€”only approved **goods and services**. Payment goes directly to **hospitals or agri suppliers**. Repayments are made with interest, improving bank profitability and reducing misuse.

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcome:
A web app that:
- Authenticates users via Fayda
- Links bank data
- Analyzes risk with AI
- Enables loan requests for health/agriculture goods

### ðŸ”— Faydaâ€™s Role:
- Identity verification via VeriFayda
- Secure login & KYC
- Ties individuals to banking and service activity

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js (Tailwind CSS, Axios)
- **Backend**: Django (DRF - Django Rest Framework)
- **AI/ML**: Python (scikit-learn for credit scoring)
- **Auth**: VeriFayda OIDC (OAuth 2.0)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Bank APIs**: Simulated with Swagger or DRF mocks
- **Version Control**: GitHub
